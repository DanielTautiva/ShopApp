# Payment Gateway [W]
This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Description
This project implements the [W] API as a payment gateway. It is developed within the ReactJS framework (Next.js 14) with a connection to a NoSQL database (MongoDB). The connection is established through MongoDB Atlas for a simpler project installation. Below are the detailed steps:

## System Requirements
- Node.js 20.10.0
